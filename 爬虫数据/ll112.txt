['Aims and objectivesTo identify and describe patients\' experiences and care needs throughout the diagnostic phase of an integrated <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> pathway.\n<br/>\n<br/>BackgroundA malignant brain tumour is a devastating diagnosis, which may cause psychical symptoms and cognitive deficits. Studies have shown that the shock of the diagnosis, combined with the multiple symptoms, affects patients\' ability to understand information and express needs of care and support. Unmet needs have been reported within this group of patients; however, the experiences and care needs of patients going through the diagnostic phase of a standardised integrated <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> pathway have not previously been explored.\n<br/>\n<br/>DesignA case study design was used to provide detailed information of the complex needs of patients being diagnosed with a malignant brain tumour.\n<br/>\n<br/>MethodsResearch interviews and direct participant observation of four patients during hospital admission, brain surgery and discharge were conducted in a Danish university hospital. Systematic text condensation was used to analyse the data material.\n<br/>\n<br/>ResultsFour major themes were identified: information needs, balancing hope and reality while trying to perceive the unknown reality of <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span>, not knowing what to expect and participants\' perceptions of the relationship with the healthcare providers. The analysis revealed that participants were in risk of having unmet information needs and that contextual factors seemed to cause fragmented care that led to feelings of uncertainty and loss of control.\n<br/>\n<br/>ConclusionsBrain tumour patients have complex care needs and experience a particular state of vulnerability during the diagnostic phase. Through personal relationships based on trust with skilled healthcare providers, participants experienced an existential recognition and alleviation of emotional distress.\n<br/>\n<br/>Relevance to clinical practicePatients receiving a brain tumour diagnosis experience unmet care needs in several areas during their hospital stay. There is a need for interventions from healthcare providers.']
