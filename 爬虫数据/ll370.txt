['As targeted therapies advance treatment for <span class="hitHilite">brain tumors</span>, standard clinical trial endpoints of survival, progression free survival and radiographic response have become insufficient to capture clinical benefit. <span class="hitHilite">Brain cancer</span> is a malignancy with neurodegenerative features. In this setting prolongation of life and/or radiographic stability are less clinically meaningful if neurocognitive function substantially declines. Hence evaluation of new therapeutic strategies should routinely include periodic assessment of neurocognitive function.']
