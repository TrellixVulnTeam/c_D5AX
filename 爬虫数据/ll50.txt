['Objectives The current study aims to find the differences between glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and giant cell glioblastoma (GCG) regarding mortality and prognosis among adults and elderly patients in the U.S. Methods and Materials This study is a historical cohort type of study and is conducted on adults and elderly individuals with GBM or GCG from the years 1985-2014 in the U.S. Data were collected from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER) database. The study exposure was GBM or GCG and the outcome was mortality. The potential confounders were age, sex, race, ethnicity, year of diagnosis, primary site, brain overlap, and surgery. A chi-square test was used for categorical data. A univariate analysis was used for variables having a p-value The study sample was 25,117. The incidences of GBM and GCG were not similar in relation to age group. Also, Spanish-Hispanic ethnicity was independently protective of GBM and GCG as compared to Non-Spanish-Hispanic ethnicity patients with GBM have a higher mortality rate than do GCG patients. The mortality rate was higher among patients diagnosed before 2010. Conclusion GCG was not statistically significant in association to reduced mortality. Non-Spanish-Hispanics with GBM or GCG had a higher mortality rate than did Spanish-Hispanics. Factors such as being female, being age 59-65, and having a year of diagnosis before 2010 were independently associated with increased mortality.']
