['Research into the diagnosis and treatment of central nervous system (CNS) diseases has been enhanced by rapid advances in nanotechnology and an expansion in the library of nanostructured carriers. This review discusses the latest applications of nanomaterials in the CNS with an emphasis on <span class="hitHilite">brain tumors</span>. Novel administration routes and transport mechanisms for nanomaterial-mediated CNS delivery of diagnostic and therapeutic agents to bypass or cross the blood brain barrier (BBB) are also discussed. These include temporary disruption of the BBB, use of impregnated polymers (polymer wafers), convection-enhanced delivery (CED), and intranasal delivery. Moreover, an in vitro BBB model capable of mimicking geometrical, cellular and rheological features of the human cerebrovasculature has been developed. This is a useful tool that can be used for screening CNS nanoparticles or therapeutics prior to in vivo and clinical investigation. A discussion of this novel model is included.
