['Human glioblastomas express higher levels of matrix metalloprotease-2 (MMP-2) than low-grade <span class="hitHilite">brain tumors</span> and normal brain tissues. Ascochlorin (ASC) has anti-metastatic, anti-angiogenic, and synergistic effect in various types of cancer cells. However, it remains unknown whether ASC can affect cell migration and invasion in malignant human glioma cells. In this study, we found that ASC indeed inhibits cell migration and invasion in U373MG and A172. ASC significantly suppresses the MMP-2 gelatinolytic activity and expression in U373MG and A172. To determine the molecular mechanism by which ASC suppressed cell migration and invasion, we investigated whether ASC could modulate metastasis via focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling, a potential drug target. ASC strongly inhibits the phosphorylation of FAK, and treatment with a FAK inhibitor significantly suppresses cancer cell migration in the presence of ASC. In addition, ASC significantly decreased phosphorylation of JAK2/STAT3, cancer cell migration and nuclear translocation of STAT3. Taken together, these results suggest that ASC inhibits cell migration and invasion by blocking FAK and JAK/STAT signaling, resulting in reduced MMP-2 activity. J. Cell. Biochem. 119: 300-313, 2018.
