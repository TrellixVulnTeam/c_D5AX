["Background Magnetic fields (MF) from AC electricity are a Possible Human Carcinogen, based on limited epidemiologic evidence from exposures far below occupational health limits. Methods To help formulate government guidance on occupational MF, the cancer cases prevented and the monetary benefits accruing to society by reducing workplace exposures were determined. Life-table methods produced Disability Adjusted Life Years, which were converted to monetary values. Results Adjusted for probabilities of causality, the expected increase in a worker's disability-free life are 0.04 year (2 weeks) from a 1microtesla (mu T) MF reduction in average worklife exposure, which is equivalent to $5,100/worker/mu T in year 2010 U.S. dollars (95% confidence interval $1,000-$9,000/worker/mu T). Where nine electrosteel workers had 13.8 mu T exposures, for example, moving them to ambient MFs would provide $600,000 in benefits to society (uncertainty interval $0-$1,000,000). Conclusions When combined with the costs of controls, this analysis provides guidance for precautionary recommendations for managing occupational MF exposures. Am. J. Ind. Med. 56:791-805, 2013.
