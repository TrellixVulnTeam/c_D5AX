['Background. Epidemiological evidence on the association between ambient air pollution and brain tumor risk is sparse and inconsistent.\n<br/>\n<br/>Methods. In 12 cohorts from 6 European countries, individual estimates of annual mean air pollution levels at the baseline residence were estimated by standardized land-use regression models developed within the ESCAPE and TRANSPHORM projects: particulate matter (PM) &lt;= 2.5, &lt;= 10, and 2.5-10 mu m in diameter (PM 2.5, PM (10), and PMcoarse), PM(2.)5 absorbance, nitrogen oxides (NO2 and NOx) and elemental composition of PM. We estimated cohort-specific associations of air pollutant concentrations and traffic intensity with total, malignant, and nonmalignant brain tumor, in separate Cox regression models, adjusting for risk factors, and pooled cohort-specific estimates using random-effects meta-analyses.\n<br/>\n<br/>Results. Of 282 194 subjects from 12 cohorts, 466 developed malignant <span class="hitHilite">brain tumors</span> during 12 years of follow-up. Six of the cohorts also had data on nonmalignant brain tumor, where among 106 786 subjects, 366 developed brain tumor: 176 nonmalignant and 190 malignant. We found a positive, statistically nonsignificant association between malignant brain tumor and PM2.5 absorbance (hazard ratio and 95% CI: 1.67; 0.89-3.14 per 10(-5)/m(3)), and weak positive or null associations with the other pollutants. Hazard ratio for PM 2.5 absorbance (1.01; 0.38-2.71 per 10(-5)/m(3)) and all other pollutants were lower for nonmalignant than for malignant <span class="hitHilite">brain tumors</span>.\n<br/>\n<br/>Conclusion. We found suggestive evidence of an association between long-term exposure to PM2.5 absorbance indicating traffic-related air pollution and malignant <span class="hitHilite">brain tumors</span>, and no association with overall or nonmalignant <span class="hitHilite">brain tumors</span>.']
