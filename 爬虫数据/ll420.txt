['Tenascin-C is an extracellular matrix protein over-expressed in a large variety of cancers. In the present study, we aimed at identifying new interactors of tenascin-C by purifying secreted proteins on a tenascin-C affinity column. Analysis of eluates by mass spectrometry revealed phosphoglycerate kinase 1, clusterin, fibronectin, SPARC-related modular calcium-binding protein 1 (SMOC1) and nidogen-2 as potential interactors of tenascin-C. The interaction between tenascin-C and SMOC1 was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and further analyzed by Surface Plasmon Resonance Spectroscopy, which revealed an apparent dissociation constant (K-D) value of 2.59 10(-9)M. Further analyses showed that this binding is reduced in the presence of EDTA. To investigate whether SMOC1 itself could be over-expressed in the context of tumorigenesis, we analyzed data of two independent RNA profiling studies and found that mRNA levels of SMOC1 are significantly increased in oligodendrogliomas compared to control brain samples. In support of these data, western blot analysis of protein extracts from 12 oligodendrogliomas, 4 astrocytomas and 13 glioblastomas revealed elevated levels compared to healthy brain extract. Interestingly, cell migration experiments revealed that SMOC1 can counteract the chemo-attractive effect of tenascin-C on U87 glioma cells. The present study thus identified SMOC1 as a new cancer-associated protein capable of interacting with tenascin-C in vitro. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.']
