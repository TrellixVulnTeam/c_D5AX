['\n<span class="hitHilite">Brain tumors</span> are characterized by very high mortality and, despite the continuous research on new pharmacological interventions, little therapeutic progress has been made. One of the main obstacles to improve current treatments is represented by the impermeability of the blood vessels residing within nervous tissue as well as of the new vascular net generating from the tumor, commonly referred to as blood-brain barrier (BBB) and blood-brain tumor barrier (BBTB), respectively. In this review, we focused on established and emerging strategies to overcome the blood-brain barrier to increase drug delivery for <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span>. To date, there are three broad strategies being investigated to cross the brain vascular wall and they are conceived to breach, bypass, and negotiate the access to the nervous tissue. In this paper, we summarized these approaches highlighting their working mechanism and their potential impact on the quality of life of the patients as well as their current status of development.']
