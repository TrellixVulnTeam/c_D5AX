['Background Patients with cancer experience many concurrent symptoms during treatment; most symptoms are treatment-related side effects. Lipid peroxidation is a treatment side effect that may increase due to generation of reactive oxygen species; this is dangerous for normal cells and tissues in cancer patients. The relationship between lipid peroxidation and symptom clusters has not been determined in patients with <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> during treatment.\n<br/>\n<br/>Objectives This study aimed to identify the changes and relationship between symptom clusters and the level of lipid peroxidation in patients with primary malignant <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> during concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT).\n<br/>\n<br/>Methods Forty-eight participants with primary high-grade <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> were enrolled; symptoms were reported using the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale. The lipid peroxidation level was evaluated using lipid ratios such as total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol/HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides/HDL cholesterol. This prospective longitudinal survey was conducted before CCRT and at 2-3 weeks and 4-6 weeks after the initiation of CCRT.\n<br/>\n<br/>Results Six symptom clusters were identified, and two were present at each time point. The lipid ratios increased along with the risk for lipid peroxidation at both time points. Symptom clusters at both time points demonstrated a significant relationship with the lipid ratio as the risk of lipid peroxidation increased.\n<br/>\n<br/>Conclusion The level of lipid peroxidation and symptom clusters in patients with high-grade <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> changed during CCRT. Lipid peroxidation in patients with high-grade <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> could be considered for symptom management during CCRT.']
