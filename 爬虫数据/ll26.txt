['This work introduces a model-based, high-definition dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI for concurrent estimation of perfusion and microvascular permeability over the whole brain. A time series of reference-subtracted signals is decomposed into one component that reflects main contrast dynamics and the other one that includes residual contrast agents (CA) and background signals. The former is described by linear superposition of a finite number of basic vectors trained from an augmented set of data that consists of tracer-kinetic model driven signal vectors and patient-specific measured ones. Contrast dynamics is estimated by solving a constrained optimization problem that incorporates the linearized signal decomposition into the measurement model of DCE MRI and then combining the main component with the background-suppressed, residual CA signals. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that prospectively enables rapid temporal sampling with 1.5 s (3 similar to 4 times higher than clinical routines) while simultaneously achieving high isotropic spatial resolution with 1.0 mm(3) (4 similar to 6 times higher than routines), enhancing estimation of both patient-specific inputs and outputs for quantification of microvascular functions. Simulations and experiments are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in patients with <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span>. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.
