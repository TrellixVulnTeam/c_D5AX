['Malignant transformation in gliomas is frequently supplemented by somatic mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 genes. It has recently emerged that mutations in these genes are associated with prolonged survival and should be used as prognostic factor in management of <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> patients. There are several approaches in use for the detection of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 mutations; however, these often exhibit shortcomings such as convoluted protocols with long processing time, complex (and costly) dedicated fluorescent probes, and/or demand on amounts of input DNA. Therefore, a simple and rapid method would be highly desired. Here, we present development and validation of simple and reliable isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 mutation detection assay using denaturing capillary electrophoresis. The detection sensitivity in terms of the limiting mutated allele fraction detectable estimated from a series of dilution runs was 2.9%. The method was validated by comparing to results obtained by a widely accepted detection technique, the multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, on a set of 85 <span class="hitHilite">brain tumors</span>. The concordance of both methods was 100%, but denaturing capillary electrophoresis assay required fivefold lower input of DNA (1 versus 5 mu L of DNA at concentrations typically between 10 and 30 ng/mu L).']
