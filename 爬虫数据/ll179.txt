['Malignant <span class="hitHilite">brain tumors</span> represent one of the most devastating forms of cancer with abject survival rates that have not changed in the past 60 years. This is partly because the brain is a critical organ, and poses unique anatomical, physiological, and immunological barriers. The unique interplay of these barriers also provides an opportunity for creative engineering solutions. Cancer immunotherapy, a means of harnessing the host immune system for anti-tumor efficacy, is becoming a standard approach for treating many cancers. However, its use in <span class="hitHilite">brain tumors</span> is not widespread. This review discusses the current approaches, and hurdles to these approaches in treating <span class="hitHilite">brain tumors</span>, with a focus on immunotherapies. We identify critical barriers to immunoengineering brain tumor therapies and discuss possible solutions to these challenges. (C) 2017 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.']
