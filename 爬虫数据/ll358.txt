['Introduction. Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is one of the most frequent neurocutaneous syndromes. NF1 can be associated with <span class="hitHilite">intracranial tumors</span> in any location, but only rarely in the corpus callosum.\n<br/>\n<br/>Aims. To describe a case of NF1 presenting as a tumor of the corpus callosum and to carry out a review of the incidence of the tumors of corpus callosum in our series and in the literature.\n<br/>\n<br/>Case report. We present a child who was studied since 3 years of age because of complete NF1 clinical diagnostic criteria (without genetic study). He was studied by MR and.magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). MR study showed neurofibromatosis bright objects distributed over several regions of the cerebral hemispheres and cerebellum, a possible brain stem tumor (bulbar zone) and the splenium of the corpus callosum. The MRS of the brain stem tumor showed changes consistent with a low grade glial tumor. The patient was followed until 19-years of age without demonstrating any changes in the clinical features or the tumor size in both locations Only six cases of corpus callosum tumor in patients with NF1 have been published to date.\n<br/>\n<br/>Conclusions. We present a new case with tumor of the corpus callosum and NF1. The imaging characteristics and the clinical course were in favour of the benign nature of this type of tumor.']
