['Four ammonium and imidazolium ionic liquids (ILs) have been synthesized and screened against the T98G cell line (<span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span>) and HEK normal cells. Treatment induced metabolic cell death (MTT), growth inhibition, clonogenic inhibition were studied as cellular response parameters. Treatment with ILs enhanced growth inhibition and cell death in a concentration dependent manner in both the T98G and HEK cell lines. At higher concentrations (&gt;0.09 mg/mL) the cytotoxic effects of the ILs were highly significant. An inhibitory effect on clonogenic capacity was also observed after cell treatment. Amongst all ILs; IL 4 (BMIMCl) exhibited potent activity against T98G <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> cells. Despite potent in-vitro activity, all ILs exhibited less cytotoxicity against the normal human HEK cells at all effective concentrations.']
