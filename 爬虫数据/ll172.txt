['Introduction:Immunostaining of progesterone receptors (PRs) has been described as a prognostic factor related to recurrences in meningiomas. However, its expression in other primary <span class="hitHilite">intracranial tumors</span> has been poorly studied. In this paper, we compare the pattern of expression of the receptor in meningiomas with that of nonmeningothelial <span class="hitHilite">intracranial tumors</span> to evaluate its value in the diagnosis of the former.Materials and Methods:A total of 42 nonmeningothelial <span class="hitHilite">intracranial tumors</span> (21 glioblastomas, 4 anaplastic oligodendrogliomas, 4 oligodendrogliomas, 1 pilomyxoid astrocytoma, 3 ependymomas, 8 schwannomas, 1 chordoid chordoma) and 32 meningiomas (1 rhabdoid, 1 papillary, 5 atypical, 7 with histologic features of more aggressive behavior, 1 microcyst, 8 meningothelial, 7 transitional, 2 fibroblastic) were studied for PR by immunohistochemistry.Results:About 73.8% of the nonmeningothelial tumors and 100% of the meningiomas were positive for the receptor, the difference being statistically significant (P=0.0017). The mean percentage of positive tumor cells per high-power field was frequently higher than 30% in meningiomas and lower than 10% in nonmeningothelial tumors (P=0.0001).Conclusions:Although we detected that immunostaining for the PR is more frequently observed in meningiomas, we confirmed its expression in diverse nonmeningothelial primary <span class="hitHilite">intracranial tumors</span>. Immunohistochemistry for PR would be useful in the diagnosis of meningioma only when its positivity shows a mean higher than 30% of the positive tumor cells per high-power field.']
