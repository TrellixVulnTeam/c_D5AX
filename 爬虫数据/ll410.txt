['The dearth of literature on <span class="hitHilite">intracranial tumors</span> (ICT) in Kuwait has necessitated this study whose objective is epidemiological. It is based on the records of the Department of Pathology, Al-Sabah Hospital, Kuwait, where virtually all brain biopsies in Kuwait were examined. Between 1995 and 2009, 439 males (53.41%) and 383 females (46.59%) had primary <span class="hitHilite">intracranial tumors</span> (PICT). Most (69%) were younger than 50 years, with 16% children and adolescents and 4% elderly (a parts per thousand yen70 years); meningioma (28%), pituitary adenoma (19%), glioblastoma (15%), astrocytoma (13%), and medulloblastoma (5%) were the most common. In childhood and adolescence, astrocytoma (35.34%) and medulloblastoma (22.56%) predominated. The mean age-adjusted incidence rate/100,000 was: PICT: 3.02; astrocytic tumors: 0.93; meningioma: 0.96; pituitary adenoma: 0.44; and medulloblastoma: 0.13. All showed a declining trend which was only statistically significant for medulloblastoma (P = 0.007). A modest correlation between the percentage of elderly in the general population and incidence rates was found (r = 0.411). Tumors with significant male preponderance were high-grade astrocytic tumors, silent pituitary adenoma (SA), and nerve sheath tumor. Meningioma had a female to male ratio of 2.24. The peak frequency for functional pituitary adenoma and females was in the age range of 20-29 years, while for SA and males it was 40-49 years. About 5% of ICT were metastatic, with cancers of breast (26%), lung (17%) and gastrointestinal (11%) origin as the most common. In conclusion, the epidemiology of PICT in Kuwait is characterized by low incidence rates and a distinct age distribution.']
