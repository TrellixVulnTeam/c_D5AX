["Objective Generic psychosocial screening tools may not reflect the unique symptom profile of brain tumour patients (BTPs). The aim was to adapt the problem list of the distress thermometer (DT) for BTPs. Methods First, items of low relevance for BTPs were identified on basis of retrospective analyses. Second, relevant yet missing problems were identified via an extensive literature search, qualitative interviews with BTPs and experts, as well as an online expert survey. The resulting raw version of the adapted problem list in BTPs was subsequently pretested. Results In the first part, data ofn= 657 BTPs were analysed. Twelve items (20%) were excluded in this step as they proved to be less relevant for BTPs (i.e., items were endorsed by less than 10% and without significant correlations to patients' DT score). In the second part, qualitative interviews and the online survey with 102 professionals led to the addition of 21 new and the modification and condensation of 17 relevant problems specific for BTPs. This adapted list was than successfully pretested inn= 19 patients, leading to the 'distress thermometer brain tumour problem list' (DT-BT), consisting of 42 relevant problems. Conclusion The adapted problem list for the DT particularly reflects the neurological and psychosocial burden of an intracranial tumour and allows for the targeted assessment of the specific burdens and needs of BTPs. Our revised version of the DTs problem list (DT-BT) should in the next step be widely validated in multinational samples."]
