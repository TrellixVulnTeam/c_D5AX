['Protein glycosylation is a posttranslational modification that affects more than half of all known proteins. Glycans covalently bound to biomolecules modulate their functions by both direct interactions, such as the recognition of glycan structures by binding partners, and indirect mechanisms that contribute to the control of protein conformation, stability, and turnover. The focus of this Review is the discussion of aberrant glycosylation related to <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span>. Altered sialylation and fucosylation of N- and O-glycans play a role in the development and progression of <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span>. Additionally, aberrant O-glycan expression has been implicated in <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span>. This Review also addresses the clinical potential and applications of aberrant glycosylation for the detection and treatment of <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span>. The viable roles glycans may play in the development of <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> therapeutics are addressed as well as cancer-glycoproteomics and personalized medicine. Glycoprotein alterations are considered as a hallmark of cancer while high expression in body fluids represents an opportunity for cancer assessment.']
