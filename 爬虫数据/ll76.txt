['OBJECTIVE: We tested the hypothesis that cerebellopontine angle (CPA) tumors are associated with a greater incidence of unruptured intracranial aneurysms (IAs).\n<br/>\n<br/>METHODS: Patients with <span class="hitHilite">intracranial tumors</span> (ITs) undergoing computed tomography angiography and magnetic resonance imaging were enrolled in an observational cohort study that prospectively collected age, sex, hypertension, diabetes, cerebral arteriosclerosis, tumor type, tumor location, hydrocephalus, smoking, alcohol intake, CPA tumor size, cerebral aneurysms, and cerebral arteriosclerosis. Patients with the coexistence of IA and IT were classified as group II, whereas the others with IT as group I.\n<br/>\n<br/>RESULTS: We included 1218 patients with IT for analysis. The incidence of IA was 7.1% (86/1218). A total of 31% of patients with aneurysms had CPA tumors. In a multivariate logistic regression model, a greater incidence of IA was found in female patients (odds ratio [OR] 1.726, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.050-2.836, P = 0.031) and in patients with CPA tumors (OR 3.002, 95% CI 1.822-4.947, P = 0.000) after adjustment for tumor type, cerebral arteriosclerosis, and age. In female patients, CPA tumors were a unique independent risk factor of a greater incidence of IA (OR 2.270, 95% CI 1.194-4.317, P = 0.012). Furthermore, cerebral arteriosclerosis was a unique independent risk factor of IA in patients with CPA tumors (OR 7.626, 95% CI 2.928-19.860, P = 0.000).\n<br/>\n<br/>CONCLUSIONS: These data support the hypothesis that CPA tumors are associated with a greater incidence of unruptured IAs, especially in female patients. Cerebral arteriosclerosis contributed to elevated risk of IA in patients with CPA tumors.']
