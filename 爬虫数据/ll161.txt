['Objective: Previous mortality studies of U.S. Gulf War veterans through 2000 and 2004 have shown an increased risk of <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> mortality among some deployed individuals. When veterans possibly exposed to environmental contaminants associated with demolition of the Khamisiyah Ammunition Storage Facility at Khamisiyah, Iraq, have been compared to contemporaneously deployed unexposed veterans, the results have suggested increased risk for mortality from <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> among the exposed. <span class="hitHilite">Brain cancer</span> mortality risk in this cohort has not been updated since 2004.\n<br/>\n<br/>Methods: This study analyzes the risk for <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> mortality between 1991-2011 through two series of comparisons: U.S. Gulf War deployed and non-deployed veterans from the same era; and veterans possibly exposed to environmental contaminants at Khamisiyah compared to contemporaneously deployed but unexposed U.S. Gulf War veterans. Risk of <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> mortality was determined using logistic regression. Life test hazard models were created to plot comparisons of annual hazard rates. Joinpoint regression models were applied to assess trends in hazard rates for <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> mortality.\n<br/>\n<br/>Results: U.S. Army veterans possibly exposed at Khamisiyah had similar rates of <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> mortality compared to those not possibly exposed; however, veterans possibly exposed had a higher risk of <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> in the time period immediately following the Gulf War.\n<br/>\n<br/>Conclusion: Results from these analyses suggest that veterans possibly exposed at Khamisiyah experienced different patterns of <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> mortality risk compared to the other groups.
