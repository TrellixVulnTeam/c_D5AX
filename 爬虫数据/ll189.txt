["Objective: To examine the psychosocial outcomes and impact of attention problems in survivors of pediatric brain tumor.\n<br/>\n<br/>Study Design: The survivors' cognitive functioning was measured using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children. The Child Behavior Checklist-Attention Problems scale was used to screen for attention problems, and participants were classified as having attention problems (n = 15) or normal attention (n = 36). Psychosocial functioning was examined with the Korean Personality Rating scale for Children (K-PRC) at precraniospinal radiation and at 2-year follow-up.\n<br/>\n<br/>Results: The attention problem group showed significantly higher depression and externalizing symptoms (delinquency, hyperactivity) and more significant impairment in family relationships than did the normal attention group at baseline. At follow-up, the attention problem group demonstrated significantly more delinquency and impaired family and social relationships. With the K-PRC scores, except for the somatization, social relationship subscale, there were significant differences between groups, but not in terms of treatment by time interaction or within time. At follow-up, multiple linear regressions showed that age at diagnosis significantly predicted K-PRC somatization (B = -1.7, P = 0.004) and social relationships (B = -1.7, P = 0.004), baseline full-scale intelligence quotient predicted K-PRC depression (B = -0.4, P = 0.032) and somatization (B = -0.3, P = 0.015), and attention problems at baseline predicted K-PRC depression (B = -15.2, P = 0.036) and social relationships (B = -11.6, P = 0.016).\n<br/>\n<br/>Conclusion: Pediatric brain tumor survivors, in particular, patients with attention problems, had worse psychosocial functioning at baseline and follow-up. Attention problems at baseline need to be carefully evaluated in assessing psychosocial functioning of pediatric brain tumor survivors."]
