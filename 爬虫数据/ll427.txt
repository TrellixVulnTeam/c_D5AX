['This review highlights the recent changes to the World Health Organization (WHO) 4th edition of the classification of central nervous system tumours. The mixed glial and neuronal tumour group continues to expand to encompass three new subtypes of glioneuronal tumours. The main diagnostic points differentiating these tumours are covered. Also covered is an update on issues relating to grading of astrocytic, oligodendroglial and pineal tumours and the recent molecular subtypes observed in medulloblastomas. The theme of molecular genetics is continued in the following section where the four subtypes in the molecular subclassification of glioblastoma; classical, mesenchymal, proneural and neural are outlined. The genetic profile of these subtypes is highlighted as is their varying biological responses to adjuvant therapies. The relationship between chromosome 1p and 19q deletions and treatment responsive oligodendrogliomas is discussed, as are the newer advances relating to silencing of the MGMT gene in astrocytomas and mutations in the IDH-1 gene in both astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas. The final section in this article provides an update on the concept of glioma stem cells.']
