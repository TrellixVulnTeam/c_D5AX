['The objective of the present study is to enhance the permeation of bioactive molecules across highly lipophilic insurmountable blood brain barrier (BBB) using folic acid (FA) functionalized poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles (FA-PNPs) coated with non-ionic surfactant, Polysorbate 80 (P-80). The developed Mtx-Tf loaded folic acid anchored PNPs formulation depicted particle size, zeta potential and entrapment efficiency of 109 +/- 2.3nm, -9.38 +/- 0.9mV and 71.0 +/- 0.6%, respectively. In vitro release showed biphasic release pattern with initial &gt;35% release in 8h followed by sustained release, up to 65% by the end of 168h. SRB cyto-toxicity assay depicted P-80-Mtx-Tf-FA-PNPs possessing better cellular cyto-toxicity (C6 Glioma) as compared to counter test formulations, i.e. 100M nano-encapsulated drug-conjugate concentration incubated for 72h resulted in apoptosis of approximate to 100% of the cellular population. Qualitatively, approximate to 85% of P-80-FITC-FA-PNPs have been found to be internalized by C6 glioma cells post 5h of incubation. Quantitative cellular uptake assay demonstrated a collinear dependence on drug-conjugate concentration. In vivo administration of P-80-Mtx-Tf-FA-PNPs depicted significant decrease, i.e. 73.6% in the tumour spheroid volume. Serum analysis data pointed towards the significant relevance of P-80-coated FA-PNPs in lowering the drug diffusion rate by 88.4% (after 30min) and three-fold enhanced retention time of drug in systemic circulation, thereby felicitating an effective prognostic treatment. This study clearly demonstrated reduced systemic toxicity, enhanced biocompatibility and anti-tumour efficacy of formulated NPs.\n<br/>\n<br/>[GRAPHICS]\n<br/>\n<br/>.']
