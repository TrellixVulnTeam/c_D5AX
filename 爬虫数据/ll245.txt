['Despite progress in surgery, radiotherapy, and in chemotherapy, an effective curative treatment of <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span>, specifically malignant gliomas, does not yet exist. The efficacy of current anti-cancer strategies in <span class="hitHilite">brain tumors</span> is limited by the lack of specific therapies against malignant cells. Besides, the delivery of the drugs to <span class="hitHilite">brain tumors</span> is limited by the presence of the blood brain barrier. Nanotechnology today offers a unique opportunity to develop more effective <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> imaging and therapeutics. In particular, the development of nanocarriers that can be conjugated with several functional molecules including tumor-specific ligands, anticancer drugs, and imaging probes, can provide new devices which are able to overcome the difficulties of the classical strategies. Nanotechnology-based approaches hold great promise for revolutionizing <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> medical treatments, imaging, and diagnosis.']
