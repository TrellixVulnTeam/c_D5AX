['\n<span class="hitHilite">Brain cancer</span> is a devastating disease. Despite extensive research, treatment of <span class="hitHilite">brain tumors</span> has been largely ineffective and the diagnosis of <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> remains uniformly fatal. Failure of <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> treatment may be in part due to limitations in drug delivery, influenced by the ABC drug efflux transporters P-gp and BCRP at the blood-brain and blood-tumor barriers, in brain tumor cells, as well as in brain tumor stem-like cells. P-gp and BCRP limit various anti-cancer drugs from entering the brain and tumor tissues, thus rendering chemotherapy ineffective. To overcome this obstacle, two strategies - targeting transporter regulation and direct transporter inhibition - have been proposed. In this review, we focus on these strategies. We first introduce the latest findings on signaling pathways that could potentially be targeted to down-regulate P-gp and BCRP expression and/or transport activity. We then highlight in detail the new paradigm of P-gp and BCRP working as a "cooperative team of gatekeepers" at the blood-brain barrier, discuss its ramifications for <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> therapy, and summarize the latest findings on dual P-gp/BCRP inhibitors. Finally, we provide a brief summary with conclusions and outline the perspectives for future research endeavors in this field.']
