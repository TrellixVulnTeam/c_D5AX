['Brain tumor is a lethal, fast growing cancer and a difficult case for treatment. Receptor-mediated endocytosis has been recognized as one of the most effective methods for drug delivery to brain tissue by overcoming obstacles associated with conventional therapeutics. In this work, a targeted theranostic drug delivery system (DDS) was prepared based on gold-iron oxide nanocomposites (Fe3O4@Au NCs). Lipoic acid-curcumin (LA-CUR) was synthesized and introduced as a novel anticancer drug, and glutathione (GSH) was exploited as the targeting ligand. Both LA-CUR and GSH were easily attached to Fe3O4@Au NCs via Au-S interaction. As a negatively charged nanocarrier, the prepared DDS showed relatively less protein adsorption. Accordingly, hemocompatibility assays (complement, platelet, and leucocyte activation) revealed its hemocompatible virtue, especially in respect of free LA-CUR. GSH functionalization led to 2-fold increase of cellular uptake in GSH receptor-positive astrocyte cells which could primarily indicate the probable ability of the DDS to bypass BBB. Cytotoxicity and apoptosis assays together showed the noticeably enhanced cytotoxicity of LA-CUR against cancerous U87MG cells (IC50 = 2.69 mu g/ml) in comparison with curcumin (IC50 = 21.31 mu g/ml); moreover, the DDS demonstrated relatively higher cytotoxicity against cancerous U87MG cells than normal astrocyte cells which was in accordance with pH sensitive mechanism of LA-CUR release. Besides, the results of in vitro magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (relaxation rate (r(2))= 80.73 (s(-1).mM(-1))) primarily revealed that the DDS can be applied as a negative MRI contrast agent. In sum, the prepared DDS appeared to be a promising candidate for <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> treatment and a favorable MRI contrast agent.']
