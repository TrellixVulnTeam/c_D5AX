['IntroductionDiffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is a high fatality pediatric <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> without effective treatment. The field of electrotherapeutics offers new potential for other forms of glioma but the efficacy of this strategy has not been reported for DIPG. This pilot study evaluated the susceptibility of patient-derived DIPG cells to low intensity electric fields delivered using a developing technology called intratumoral modulation therapy (IMT).MethodsDIPG cells from autopsy specimens were treated with a custom-designed, in vitro IMT system. Computer-generated electric field simulation was performed to quantify IMT amplitude and distribution using continuous, low intensity, intermediate frequency stimulation parameters. Treatment groups included sham, IMT, temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy and radiation therapy (RT). The impact of single and multi-modality therapy was compared using spectrophotometric and flow cytometry viability analyses.ResultsDIPG cells exhibited robust, consistent susceptibility to IMT fields that significantly reduced cell viability compared to untreated control levels. The ratio of viable:non-viable DIPG cells transformed from 6:1 in sham-treated to 1.5:1 in IMT-treated conditions. The impact of IMT was similar to that of dual modality TMZ-RT therapy and the addition of IMT to this treatment combination dramatically reduced DIPG cell viability to 20% of control values.ConclusionsThis proof-of-concept study provides a novel demonstration of marked DIPG cell susceptibility to low intensity electric fields delivered using IMT. The potent impact as a monotherapy and when integrated into multi-modality treatment platforms justifies further investigations into the potential of IMT as a critically needed biomedical innovation for DIPG.']
