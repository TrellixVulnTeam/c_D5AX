['The chemotherapy of aggressive glioma is usually accompanied by a poor prognosis because of the formation of vasculogenic mimicry (VM) and <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> stem cells (BCSCs). VM provided a transporting pathway for nutrients and blood to the extravascular regions of the tumor, and BCSCs were always related to drug resistance and the relapse of glioma. Thus, it is important to evaluate the inhibition effect of antiglioma drug delivery systems on both VM and BCSCs. In this study, paclitaxel-loaded liposomes modified with a multifunctional tandem peptide R8-c(RGD) (R8-c(RGD)-Lip) were used for the treatment of glioma. An in vitro cellular uptake study proved the strongest targeting ability to be that of R8-c(RGD)-Lip to glioma stem cells. Drug loaded R8-c(RGD)-Lip exhibited an efficient antiproliferation effect on BCSCs and could induce the destruction of VM channels in vitro. The following pharmacodynamics study demonstrated that R8-c(RGD)-modified drug-loaded liposomes achieved both anti-VM and anti-BCSC effects in vivo. Finally, no significant cytotoxicity of the blood system or major organs of the drug-loaded liposomes was observed under treatment dosage in the safety evaluation. In conclusion, all of the results proved that R8-c(RGD)-Lip was a safe and efficient antiglioma drug delivery system.']
