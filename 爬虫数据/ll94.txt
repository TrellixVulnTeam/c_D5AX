['Peptidyl prolyl isomerases (PPIases) are broadly expressed enzymes that accelerate the cis-trans isomerization of proline peptide bonds. The most extensively studied PPIase family member is protein interacting with never in mitosis A1 (PIN1), which isomerizes phosphorylated serine/threonine-proline bonds. By catalyzing this specific cis-trans isomerization, PIN1 can alter the structure of its target proteins and modulate their activities in a number of different ways. Many proteins are targets of proline-directed phosphorylation and thus PIN1-mediated isomerization of proline bonds represents an important step in the regulation of a variety of cellular mechanisms. Numerous other proteins in addition to PIN1 are endowed with PPIase activity. These include other members of the parvulin family to which PIN1 belongs, such as PIN4, as well as several cyclophilins and FK506-binding proteins. Unlike PIN1, however, these other PPIases do not isomerize phosphorylated serine/threonine-proline bonds and have different substrate specificities. PIN1 and other PPIases are overexpressed in many types of cancer and have been implicated in various oncogenic processes. This review will discuss studies providing evidence for multiple roles of PIN1 and other PPIases in glioblastoma and medulloblastoma, the most frequent adult and pediatric primary <span class="hitHilite">brain tumors</span>.']
