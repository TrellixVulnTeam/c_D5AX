['Stem cell chemoresistance remains challenging the efficacy of the front-line temozolomide against glioblastoma. Novel therapies are urgently needed to fight those cells in order to control tumor relapse. Here, we report that anti-O-acetyl-GD2 adjuvant immunotherapy controls glioma stem-like cell-driven chemoresistance. Using patient-derived glioblastoma cells, we found that glioma stem-like cells overexpressed O-acetyl-GD2. As a result, monoclonal antibody 8B6 immunotherapy significantly increased temozolomide genotoxicity and tumor cell death in vitro by enhancing temozolomide tumor uptake. Furthermore, the combination therapy decreased the expression of the glioma stem-like cell markers CD133 and Nestin and compromised glioma stem-like cell self-renewal capabilities. When tested in vivo, adjuvant 8B6 immunotherapy prevented the extension of the temozolomide-resistant glioma stem-like cell pool within the tumor bulk in vivo and was more effective than the single agent therapies. This is the first report demonstrating that anti-O-acetyl-GD2 monoclonal antibody 8B6 targets glioblastoma in a manner that control temozolomide-resistance driven by glioma stem-like cells. Together our results offer a proof of concept for using anti-O-acetyl GD2 reagents in glioblastoma to develop more efficient combination therapies for malignant gliomas.']
