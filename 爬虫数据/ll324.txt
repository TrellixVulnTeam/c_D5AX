['The aim of the study is to evaluate the etiologic and clinical characteristics, treatment regimens, and outcome of the patients with <span class="hitHilite">intracranial tumors</span> presenting with central diabetes insipidus (DI). Sixty-nine patients with <span class="hitHilite">intracranial tumors</span> presenting with central DI between 1972 and 2012 were retrospectively evaluated. Fifty-three out of 69 patients were included in the analysis. Male/female ratio was 1.52, median age was 7.6 years. Of 53 patients, 37 patients (69.8%) were diagnosed with Langerhans cell histiocytosis, 14 patients (26.4%) with germinoma, 1 (1.9%) with astrocytoma, and 1 (1.9%) with optic glioma. 10-year overall survival (OS) rate and disease-free survival rate for all patients were 91.7% and 52%. 10-year OS rate according to diagnostic criteria was 91% for Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) cases, 79% for intracranial germinoma, which was statistically significant (P = .0001). Central DI may be very important clinical presentation of serious underlying disease in children. <span class="hitHilite">Intracranial tumors</span> are the most frequent cause of DI. Most frequent diagnosis were LCH and germ cell tumors in our series.']
