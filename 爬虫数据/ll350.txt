['Gliomas, primary brain cancers, are characterized by remarkable invasiveness and fast growth. While they share many qualities with other solid tumors, gliomas have developed special mechanisms to convert the cramped brain space and other limitations afforded by the privileged central nervous system into pathophysiological advantages. In this review we discuss gliomas and other primary brain cancers in the context of acid-base regulation and interstitial acidification; namely, how the altered proton (H+) content surrounding these <span class="hitHilite">brain tumors</span> influences tumor development in both autocrine and paracrine manners. As proton movement is directly coupled to movement of other ions, pH serves as both a regulator of cell activity as well as an indirect readout of other cellular functions. In the case of <span class="hitHilite">brain tumors</span>, these processes result in pathophysiology unique to the central nervous system. We will highlight what is known about pH-sensitive processes in <span class="hitHilite">brain tumors</span> in addition to gleaning insight from other solid tumors.']
