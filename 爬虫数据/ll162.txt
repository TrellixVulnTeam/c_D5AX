['Background "Conditional survival probability" is defined as the probability that a patient will survive an additional time, given that the patient has already survived a defined period of time after diagnosis. Such estimates might be more relevant for clinicians and patients during post-diagnosis care, because survival probability projections are based on the patient\'s survival to date. Here, we provides the first population-based estimates of conditional survival probabilities by histology for <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> in Canada.\n<br/>\n<br/>Methods Canadian Cancer Registry data were accessed for patients diagnosed with primary brain cancers during 2000-2008. Kaplan-Meier survival probabilities were estimated by histology. Conditional survival probabilities at 6 months (short-term, denoted scs) and 2 years (long-term, denoted Lcs) were derived from the Kaplan-Meier survival estimates for a range of time periods.\n<br/>\n<br/>Results Among the 20,875 patients who met the study criteria, scs increased by a margin of 16-18 percentage points from 6-month survivors to 2-year survivors for the three most aggressive brain cancers. The lcs for 2-year survivors was 66% or greater for all tumour groups except glioblastoma. The lcs for 4-year survivors was 62% or greater for all histologies. For glioblastoma and diffuse astrocytoma, the lcs increased each year after diagnosis. For all other histologies, the lcs first increased and then plateaued from 2 years after diagnosis. The lcs and scs both worsened with increasing older age at diagnosis.\n<br/>\n<br/>Summary We report histologically specific conditional survival probabilities that can have value for clinicians practicing in Canada as they plan the course of follow-up for individual patients with <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span>.']
