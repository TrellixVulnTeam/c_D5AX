['\n<span class="hitHilite">Brain cancer</span> is a highly lethal disease, especially devastating toward both the elderly and children. This cancer has no therapeutics available to combat it, predominately due to the blood-brain barrier (BBB) preventing treatments from maintaining therapeutic levels within the brain. Recently, nanoparticle technology has entered the forefront of cancer therapy due to its ability to deliver therapeutic effects while potentially passing physiological barriers. Key nanoparticles for <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> treatment include glutathione targeted PEGylated liposomes, gold nanoparticles, superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles and nanoparticle-albumin bound drugs, with these being discussed throughout this review. Recently, the survivin protein has gained attention as it is over-expressed in a majority of tumors. This review will briefly discuss the properties of survivin, while focusing on how both nanoparticles and survivin-targeting treatments hold potential as <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> therapies. This review may provide useful insight into new <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> treatment options, particularly survivin inhibition and nanomedicine.']
