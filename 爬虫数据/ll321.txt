['This study evaluated unique exposures and their relationship to <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> mortality in employees of a specialty chemical research facility. Following an exposure assessment that concerned compounds distinct to this facility, the authors conducted a cohort mortality study of 5,284 workers to assess mortality in reference to the general population and a nested case-control study to evaluate <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> risk associated with specific jobs and unique chemical exposures. Four hundred eighty-six deaths, including 14 <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> deaths, were identified. Overall mortality was lower than expected. <span class="hitHilite">Brain cancer</span> mortality was elevated (standardized mortality ratio [SMR] = 2.02, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.11-3.40). Exposures to 5 specific chemical categories were assessed. Exploration of work history and the specific chemical exposures did not explain the <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> cases. No clear occupational etiology was identified.']
