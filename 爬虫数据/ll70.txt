['BackgroundPrevious studies had demonstrated some associations between coffee and tea consumption and <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> risk resulted in an inconsistent relationship. We therefore performed this study to further explore the association between them.MethodBy searching PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science, we retrieved up to 1 November 2018, 11 relevant literature of publications were collected by 2 people eventually. Stata 14.0 software was used for data analysis.ResultsIn total, 11 articles (11 articles for coffee, 8 articles for tea, and 4 articles for coffee plus tea) were used in this meta-analysis. A statistically significant protective effect of coffee consumption and <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> risk was found (RR=0.785, 95% CI=0.580-0.984, I-2=65.6%, P-for heterogeneity=0.001), especially in Asian populations (RR=0.217, 95% CI=0.042-0.896). However, the association between the risk of <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> and tea consumption was non-significant in the whole result (RR=0.897, 95% CI=0.739-1.088, I-2=29.9%, P-for heterogeneity=0.189), but significant in American populations (RR=0.798, 95% CI=0.646-0.986). Interestingly, the RR was 0.684 (95% CI=0.481-0.975) for the risk of <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> when compared the highest versus the lowest category consumption of coffee plus tea.ConclusionFindings from this study suggested that higher consumption of coffee may contribute to the lower development of <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> in Asian populations. Tea consumption had an inverse association for the risk of <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> in American populations, instead of other populations.']
