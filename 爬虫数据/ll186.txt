['Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR) are predominantly involved in maintenance of cellular homeostasis of central nervous system. However, evidences have suggested other roles of mGluR in human tumors. Aberrant mGluR signaling has been shown to participate in transformation and maintenance of various cancer types, including malignant <span class="hitHilite">brain tumors</span>. This review intends to summarize recent findings regarding the involvement of mGluR-mediated intracellular signaling pathways in progression, aggressiveness, and recurrence of malignant gliomas, mainly glioblastomas (GBM), highlighting the potential therapeutic applications of mGluR ligands. In addition to the growing number of studies reporting mGluR gene or protein expression in glioma samples (resections, lineages, and primary cultures), pharmacological blockade in vitro of mGluR1 and mGluR3 by selective ligands has been shown to be anti-proliferative and anti-migratory, decreasing activation of MAPK and PI3K pathways. In addition, mGluR3 antagonists promoted astroglial differentiation of GBM cells and also enabled cytotoxic action of temozolomide (TMZ). mGluR3dependent TMZ toxicity was supported by increasing levels of MGMT transcripts through an intracellular signaling pathway that sequentially involves PI3K and NF.B. Further, continuous pharmacological blockade of mGluR1 and mGluR3 have been shown to reduced growth of GBM tumor in two independent in vivo xenograft models. In parallel, low levels of mGluR3 mRNA in GBM resections may be a predictor for long survival rate of patients. Since several Phase I, II and III clinical trials are being performed using group I and II mGluR modulators, there is a strong scientificallybased rationale for testing mGluR antagonists as an adjuvant therapy for malignant <span class="hitHilite">brain tumors</span>.']
