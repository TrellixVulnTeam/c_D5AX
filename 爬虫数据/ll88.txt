['Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the experience of patients with <span class="hitHilite">brain tumors</span> and their carers across distinct parts of their treatment pathway and identify their views on potential service gaps in need of addressing.\n<br/>\n<br/>Methods: A structured survey was administered at patient workshops across the UK and online through a charity newsletter. Answers to closed questions were analyzed using descriptive statistics, and open questions were examined using techniques of inductive content analysis.\n<br/>\n<br/>Results: A total of 136 survey responses were received, representing patients with a variety of diagnoses and geographical locations (30 counties). There was a wide range of opinions on the provision of current neuro-oncology services. Key themes identified included a perceived lack of information provision, a gap in postdischarge psychological and neuropsychological supports, and an unmet willingness for involvement in research.\n<br/>\n<br/>Conclusion: This national survey enhances our knowledge of current patient and carer experience within neuro-oncology services. A number of areas of unmet clinical need are highlighted providing a basis for informing future patient-centered service improvements and research.']
