['The three-dimensional (3D) cell culture model has been increasingly used to study cancer biology and screen for anticancer agents due to its close mimicry to in vivo tumor biopsies. In this study, 3D calcium(Ca)-alginate scaffolds were developed for human glioblastoma cell culture and an investigation of the responses to two anticancer agents, doxorubicin and cordycepin. Compared to the 2D monolayer culture, glioblastoma cells cultured on these 3D Ca-alginate scaffolds showed reduced cell proliferation, increased tumor spheroid formation, enhanced expression of cancer stem cell genes (CD133, SOX2, Nestin, and Musashi-1), and improved expression of differentiation potential-associated genes (GFAP and beta-tubulin III). Additionally, the vascularization potential of the 3D glioblastoma cells was increased, as indicated by a higher expression of tumor angiogenesis biomarker (VEGF) than in the cells in 2D culture. To highlight the application of Ca-alginate scaffolds, the 3D glioblastomas were treated with anticancer agents, including doxorubicin and cordycepin. The results demonstrated that the 3D glioblastomas presented a greater resistance to the tested anticancer agents than that of the cells in 2D culture. In summary, the 3D Ca-alginate scaffolds for glioblastoma cells that were developed in this study offer a promising platform for anticancer agent screening and the discovery of drug-resistant mechanisms of cancer.']
