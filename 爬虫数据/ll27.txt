['Background: Pisosterol, a triterpene derived from Pisolithus tirietorius, exhibits potential antitumor activity in various malignancies. However, the molecular mechanisms that mediate the pisosterol-specific effects on glioma cells remain unknown.\n<br/>\n<br/>Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the antitumoral effects of pisosterol on glioma cell lines.\n<br/>\n<br/>Methods: The 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) and trypan hlue exclusion assays were used to evaluate the effect of pisosterol on cell proliferation and viability in glioma cells. The effect of pisosterol on the distribution of the cells in the cell cycle was performed by flow cytometry. The expression and methylation pattern of the promoter region of MYC, ATM, BC1,2, Billll, CASP3, CDKI, CDKVIA, CDKN2A, CDKAr2B, CHEKI, p14(ARP) and TP53 was analyzed by RT-qPCR, western blotting and bisulfite sequencing PCR (BSP-PCR).\n<br/>\n<br/>Results: Here, it has been reported that pisosterol markedly induced G,All arrest and apoptosis and decreased the cell viability and proliferation potential of glioma cells in a dose-dependent manner by increasing the expression of ATM, CA.SP3, CDKI, CDKATI A, CDKAT2A, CDKAT213, CHEKI, 1714,4RF and :TP53 and decreasing the expression of MYC, RCL2, HAM and AID,112. Pisosterol also triggered both caspase-independent and caspase-dependent apoptotic pathways by regulating the expression of Bc1-2 and activating caspase-3 and p53.\n<br/>\n<br/>Conclusion: It has been, for the first time, confirmed that the ATM/ATR signaling pathway is a critical mechanism for G(2)/M arrest in pisosterol-induced glioma cell cycle arrest and suggests that this compound might be a promising anticancer candidate for further investigation.']
