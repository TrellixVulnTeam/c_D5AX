['Glioblastoma is the most aggressive and lethal primary brain malignancy, with an average patient survival from diagnosis of 14 months. Glioblastoma also usually progresses as a more invasive phenotype after initial treatment. A major step forward in our understanding of the nature of glioblastoma was achieved with large-scale expression analysis. However, due to genomic complexity and heterogeneity, transcriptomics alone is not enough to define the glioblastoma "fingerprint", so epigenetic mechanisms are being examined, including the noncoding genome. On the basis of their tissue specificity, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are being explored as new diagnostic and therapeutic targets. In addition, growing evidence indicates that lncRNAs have various roles in resistance to glioblastoma therapies (e.g., MALAT1, H19) and in glioblastoma progression (e.g., CRNDE, HOTAIRM1, ASLNC22381, ASLNC20819). Investigations have also focused on the prognostic value of lncRNAs, as well as the definition of the molecular signatures of glioma, to provide more precise tumor classification. This review discusses the potential that lncRNAs hold for the development of novel diagnostic and, hopefully, therapeutic targets that can contribute to prolonged survival and improved quality of life for patients with glioblastoma.']
