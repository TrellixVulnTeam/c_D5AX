["Activation of beta(2)-adrenergic receptor (beta(2)AR) and deorphanized GPR55 has been shown to modulate cancer growth in diverse tumor types in vitro and in xenograft models in vivo. (R,R'-4'-methoxy-1-naphthylfenoterol [(R,R')-MNF] is a bivalent compound that agonizes beta(2)AR but inhibits GPR55-mediated pro-oncogenic responses. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-tumorigenic effects of concurrent beta(2)AR activation and GPR55 blockade in C6 glioma cells using (R,R')-MNF as a marker ligand. Our data show that (R,R')-MNF elicited G1-phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, reduced serum-inducible cell motility, promoted the phosphorylation of PICA target proteins, and inhibited constitutive activation of ERIC and AKT in the low nanomolar range, whereas high nanomolar levels of (R,R')-MNF were required to block GPR55-mediated cell motility. siRNA knockdown and pharmacological inhibition of beta(2)AR activity were accompanied by significant upregulation of AKT and ERIC phosphorylation, and selective alteration in (R,R')-MNF responsiveness. The effects of agonist stimulation of GPR55 on various readouts, including cell motility assays, were suppressed by (R,R')-MNF. Lastly, a significant increase in phosphorylation-mediated inactivation of beta-catenin occurred with (R,R')-MNF, and we provided new evidence of (R,R')-MNF-mediated inhibition of oncogenic beta(2)-catenin signaling in a C6 xenograft tumor model. Thus, simultaneous activation of beta(2)AR and blockade of GPR55 may represent a novel therapeutic approach to combat the progression of glioblastoma cancer."]
