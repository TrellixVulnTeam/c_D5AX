['Accumulating evidence suggests that in several types of <span class="hitHilite">brain tumors</span>, including glioma, only a phenotypic subset of tumor cells called <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> stem cells (BCSCs) may be capable of initiating tumor growth. Recently, the isolation of side population (SP) cells using Hoechst dye has become a useful method for obtaining cancer stem cells in various tumors. In this study, we isolated cancer stem-like cells from human glioma cell lines using the SP technique. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that SK-MG-1, a human glioblastoma cell line, contained the largest number of SP cells among the five glioma cell lines that were analyzed. The SP cells had a self-renewal ability and were capable of forming spheres in a neurosphere culture medium containing EGF and FGF2. Spheres derived from the SP cells differentiated into three different lineage cells: neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. RT-PCR analysis revealed that the SP cells expressed a neural stem cell marker, Nestin. The SP cells generated tumors in the brains of NOD/SCID mice at 8 weeks after implantation, whereas the non-SP cells did not generate any tumors in the brain. These results indicate that SP cells isolated from SK-MG-1 possess the properties of cancer stem cells, including their self-renewal ability, multi-lineage differentiation, and tumorigenicity. Therefore, the SP cells from SK-MG-1 may be useful for analyzing BCSCs because of the ease with which they can be handled and their yield. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.']
