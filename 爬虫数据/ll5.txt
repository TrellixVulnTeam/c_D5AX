['Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a common type of <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span>, has a very poor prognosis. In general, viable GBM cells exhibit elevated phosphatidylserine (PS) on their membrane surface compared to healthy cells. We have developed a drug, saposin C-dioleoylphosphatidylserine (SapC-DOPS), that selectively targets cancer cells by honing in on this surface PS. To examine whether SapC-DOPS, a stable, blood-brain barrier-penetrable nanovesicle, could be an effective delivery system for precise targeted therapy of radiation, we iodinated several carbocyanine-based fluorescent reporters with either stable iodine (I-127) or radioactive isotopes (I-125 and(131)I). While all of the compounds, when incorporated into the SapC-DOPS delivery system, were taken up by human GBM cell lines, we chose the two that best accumulated in the cells (DiI (22,3) and DiD (16,16)). Pharmacokinetics were conducted with(125)I-labeled compounds and indicated that DiI (22,3)-SapC-DOPS had a time to peak in the blood of 0.66 h and an elimination half-life of 8.4 h. These values were 4 h and 11.5 h, respectively, for DiD (16,16)-SapC-DOPS. Adult nude mice with GBM cells implanted in their brains were treated with(131)I-DID (16,16)-SapC-DOPS. Mice receiving the radionuclide survived nearly 50% longer than the control groups. These data suggest a potential novel, personalized treatment for a devastating brain disease.']
