['The objective of present study was to enhance permeation of bioactive molecules across blood brain barrier (BBB) through polysorbate 80 coated poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) nanoparticles (NPs) loaded with methotrexate-transferrin (Tw-Mtx-Tf-NP) conjugates (Mtx-Tf). The easy trans-BBB migration of developed formulations through endocytosis, and inhibition of P-gp efflux pump present in brain were established by Pluronic F-68 and/or polysorbate 80 (Tween 80/Tw). The over-expression of transferrin (Tf) receptors on cancer cell surface allowed targeted and sustained delivery of Mtx-Tf conjugated to <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> cells by receptor mediated endocytosis. The developed formulations showed improved penetration in comparison to non-targeting experimental NP controls. The transportation potential and bio-distribution studies of such nanosized polymeric carriers showing successful migration and trans-BBB passage was carried out by administering FITC labeled drug loaded NPs to albino rats through intravenous route. We have validated anti-tumor efficiency of newly formulated and drug loaded NPs compared to controls in experimentally induced tumor-harboring rat model. The present study suggests greater compatibility, less organ toxicity and higher anti-tumor activity of developed formulations due to their targeting and sustained delivery potential in cancer therapeutic interventions. In conclusion, our findings of targeted and sustained drug delivery potential of NPs for are corroborated with in vitro and in vivo evidence, and formulated novel delivery vehicle shows its value in developing new tools for treating <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span>.
