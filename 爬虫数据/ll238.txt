['Purpose: Recently, natural D-glucose was suggested as a potential biodegradable contrast agent. The feasibility of using D-glucose for dynamic perfusion imaging was explored to detect malignant <span class="hitHilite">brain tumors</span> based on blood brain barrier breakdown.\n<br/>\n<br/>Methods: Mice were inoculated orthotopically with human U87-EGFRvIII glioma cells. Time-resolved glucose signal changes were detected using chemical exchange saturation transfer (glucoCEST) MRI. Dynamic glucose enhanced (DGE) MRI was used to measure tissue response to an intravenous bolus of D-glucose.\n<br/>\n<br/>Results: DGE images of mouse brains bearing human glioma showed two times higher and persistent changes in tumor compared with contralateral brain. Area-under-curve (AUC) analysis of DGE delineated blood vessels and tumor and had contrast comparable to the AUC determined using dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI with GdDTPA, both showing a significantly higher AUC in tumor than in brain (P &lt; 0.005). Both CEST and relaxation effects contribute to the signal change.\n<br/>\n<br/>Conclusion: DGE MRI is a feasible technique for studying brain tumor enhancement reflecting differences in tumor blood volume and permeability with respect to normal brain. We expect DGE will provide a low-risk and less expensive alternative to DCE MRI for imaging cancer in vulnerable populations, such as children and patients with renal impairment.
