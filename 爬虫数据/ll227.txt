['BACKGROUND: Solitary fibrous tumors are rare benign mesenchymal neoplasms characterized by involvement of many sites all over the body with uncommon presentation within the cranium. Furthermore, malignant bilateral basifrontal solitary fibrous tumor is extremely rare. Although uncommon, this rare entity may be included in the differential diagnosis of frontal tumors in adults, to ensure complete surgical resection. The tumor falls under the spectrum of fibroblastic proliferation and shares close morphological overlap with meningiomas and hemangiopericytomas, posing a diagnostic challenge for the histopathologist.\n<br/>\n<br/>CASE: We report a case of a malignant solitary fibrous tumor in the bilateral basifrontal region in a 50-year-old woman who presented with intermittent headache and vomiting and was clinicoradiologically diagnosed with meningioma.\n<br/>\n<br/>CONCLUSION: Clinicoradiological and pathological correlation is required for recognizing the aggressive behavior of this tumor and aiding the clinician for appropriate surgical management (complete surgical resection) and close sequential follow-up.']
