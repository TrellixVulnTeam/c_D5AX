['Poultry consumption, as well as egg consumption for <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> risk remains an important topic. The objective of this meta-analysis is to investigate the role of poultry and egg consumption for <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> risk. All articles about poultry and egg consumption for <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> were retrieved from PubMed, Web of knowledge and Wan Fang Med Online. The data was analyzed using Stata 12.0 software. Ten articles (6 articles for poultry and 5 articles for egg) were included. For poultry consumption, the summarized relative risk (RR) was 0.901 (95%CI= 0.703-1.154) for <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> risk, with high between-study heterogeneity (I-2 = 60.7%, P=0.018). Four studies reported the association between poultry consumption and glioma risk, yielding a RR of 0.873 (95%CI= 0.737-1.034, I-2= 0.0%, P=0.838). The association between egg consumption and <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> risk was not significant (RR= 0.998, 95%Cl- 0.552-1.805), with significant heterogeneity (I-2 = 82.6%, P&lt; 0.001). The pooled RR for glioma risk was 1.472 (95%CI= 0.935-2.316). In summary, our results concluded that poultry and egg consumption may be not associated with the risk of <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span>. Due to the limited quality of evidence currently available, more studies related to poultry and egg consumption for <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> is necessary.']
