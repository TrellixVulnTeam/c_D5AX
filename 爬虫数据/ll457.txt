['Purpose: To investigate <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> patients \'satisfaction hospitalised in a tertiary care university public hospital in Alexandroupolis, Greece, in order to improve medical, nursing, and organizational-administrative services.\n<br/>\n<br/>Methods: This cross-sectional study involved 163 patients having been hospitalised for at least 24 hours. The patients were asked to fill in a satisfaction questionnaire previously approved by the Greek Ministry of Health. Four aspects of satisfaction were investigated (medical, hotel accommodation/organisational facilities, nursing, global). Using Principal Component Analysis, summated scales were formed and tested for internal consistency using Cronbach\'s alpha coefficient. The non parametric Spearman S rank correlation coefficient was also used and the threshold p-value for statistical significance (2-sided) was set at 0.05.\n<br/>\n<br/>Results: The results revealed a high degree of global satisfaction (73.31%), yet satisfaction was higher for the medical (88.88%) and nursing (84.26%) services. Moreover satisfaction derived from the accommodation facilities and the general organisation was found to be more limited (74.17%). Statistically significant differences (based on various demographic variables) in the participants\' global satisfaction were not observed. On the contrary self:assessment of health status at admission was negatively correlated with medical (r(s)=0.157, p=0.045) and nursing (r(s)=-0.168. p=0.032) satisfaction. Greek citizenship contributed to bigger satisfaction scores in the accommodation/organisational facilities dimension (r(s)=0.158, p=0.044). Finally age was positively linked to nursing satisfaction (r(s)=0.181, p=0.02).\n<br/>\n<br/>Conclusion: The present study confirmed in part the results of previously published Greek surveys assessing general patient populations. However more studies are urgently needed to confirm these findings in a much bigger <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> population.']
