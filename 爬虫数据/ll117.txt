['Despite our growing molecular-level understanding of glioblastoma (GBM), treatment modalities remain limited. Recent developments in the mechanisms of cell fate regulation and nanomedicine provide new avenues by which to treat and manage <span class="hitHilite">brain tumors</span> via the delivery of molecular therapeutics. Here, we have developed bioreducible poly(beta-amino ester) nanoparticles that demonstrate high intracellular delivery efficacy, low cytotoxicity, escape from endosomes, and promotion of cytosol-targeted environmentally triggered cargo release for miRNA delivery to tumor-propagating human cancer stem cells. In this report, we combined this nanobiotechnology with newly discovered cancer stem cell inhibiting miRNAs to develop self-assembled miRNA-containing polymeric nanoparticles (nano-miRs) to treat gliomas. We show that these nano-miRs effectively intracellularly deliver single and combination miRNA mimics that inhibit the stem cell phenotype of human GBM cells in vitro. Following direct intratumoral infusion, these nano-miRs were found to distribute through the tumors, inhibit the growth of established orthotopic human GBM xenografts, and cooperatively enhance the response to standard-of-care gamma radiation. Co-delivery of two miRNAs, miR-148a and miR-296-Sp, within the bioreducible nano-miR particles enabled long-term survival from GBM in mice.']
