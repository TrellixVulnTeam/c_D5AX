['Histopathological whole slide images of haematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E)-stained biopsies contain valuable information with relation to cancer disease and its clinical outcomes. Still, there are no highly accurate automated methods to correlate histolopathological images with <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> patients\' survival, which can help in scheduling patients therapeutic treatment and allocate time for preclinical studies to guide personalized treatments. We now propose a new classifier, namely, DeepSurvNet powered by deep convolutional neural networks, to accurately classify in 4 classes <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> patients\' survival rate based on histopathological images (class I, 0-6 months; class II, 6-12 months; class III, 12-24 months; and class IV, &gt;24 months survival after diagnosis). After training and testing of DeepSurvNet model on a public <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> dataset, The Cancer Genome Atlas, we have generalized it using independent testing on unseen samples. Using DeepSurvNet, we obtained precisions of 0.99 and 0.8 in the testing phases on the mentioned datasets, respectively, which shows DeepSurvNet is a reliable classifier for <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> patients\' survival rate classification based on histopathological images. Finally, analysis of the frequency of mutations revealed differences in terms of frequency and type of genes associated to each class, supporting the idea of a different genetic fingerprint associated to patient survival. We conclude that DeepSurvNet constitutes a new artificial intelligence tool to assess the survival rate in <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span>.\n<br/>\n<br/>Graphical abstract A DCNN model was generated to accurately predict survival rates of <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> patients (classified in 4 different classes) accurately. After training the model using images from H&amp;E stained tissue biopsies from The Cancer Genome Atlas database (TCGA, left), the model can predict for each patient, based on a histological image (top right), its survival class accurately (bottom right).']
