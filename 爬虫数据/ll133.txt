['This is a single centre study in mainland China aiming to evaluate the reliability, validity and responsiveness of the Chinese version of EORTC QLQ-BN20, designed by The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Group to evaluate the life quality of patients with brain tumour, cancer or metastases. One hundred and eighty-eight patients with primary or secondary <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> from Hunan Provincial Tumor Hospital during September 2013 to June 2014 completed the Chinese EORTC QLQ-C30/BN20 questionnaires developed by translation, back translation and cultural adaptation. Results were statistically analysed using SPSS17.0. The internal consistency (Cronbach\'s coefficient) was between .753 and .869, the correlation coefficients among items and its own dimension were bigger than .4, and all items had a better correlation with its own dimension. The Spearman was used to analyse the correlation of each dimension between EORTC QLQ-BN20 and EORTC QLQ-C30, and the result showed that individual dimensions were moderately correlated, other dimensions were weakly correlated. In conclusion, the Chinese version of EORTC QLQ BN20 questionnaire had great relevance, reliability, convergent validity and discriminant validity. It provides a valuable tool for the assessment of health-related quality of life in clinical studies of Chinese patients with primary or secondary <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span>.']
