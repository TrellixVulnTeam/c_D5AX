['Wernicke encephalopathy represents a well-known entity characterized by a set of cognitive and neurologic alterations. Wernicke encephalopathy is rare and under-recognized in childhood and may be fatal. Few cases have been documented in pediatric oncology. We report on 2Wernicke encephalopathy cases that occurred in children having a brain tumor. The diagnosis of Wernicke encephalopathy was suggested by clinical manifestations associated with the typical radiologic findings and a laboratory evidence of thiamine deficiency. No large series have been published to support the evidence that pediatric malignancies represent a demonstrated factor of increased risk to develop a Wernicke encephalopathy. Moreover, the diagnosis may be even more difficult in <span class="hitHilite">brain tumors</span>, considering the overlapping symptoms and the risk of encephalopathy related to both the disease and the treatment. Wernicke encephalopathy should be considered in all children with cancer presenting a neurologic deterioration, mainly in <span class="hitHilite">brain tumors</span>. An early diagnosis is imperative for a prompt therapy that might prevent or minimize the irreversible brain damage related to this condition.']
