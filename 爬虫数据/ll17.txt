['Objective To investigate positioning error analysis of the Fraxion localization system in the intracranial stereotactic radiotherapy of tumors. Methods 64 patients were divided into two groups: a control group (36 patients with the standard thermoplastic mask) and a model group (28 patients with the Fraxion localization system). 3D images of the treated position were obtained by cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). Positioning errors were obtained by, respectively, registering these two sets of CBCT images to planning CT images, using a 6 degrees-freedom robotic patient positioning system (HexaPOD Evo RT System). The changes in positioning errors with the Fraxion localization system and with the standard thermoplastic mask were analyzed. Results CBCT scan results of the model group showed that the mean of linear error of three directions [superior-inferior (SI), lateral (LAT), and anterior-posterior (AP)] was 0.710 +/- 0.676 mm, 0.817 +/- 0.687 mm, and 0.710 +/- 0.685 mm, respectively. The corresponding PTV was 1.23 mm, 1.26 mm, and 1.36 mm. The differences between the 3D images and the planned CT images were significant (p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion The Fraxion radiotherapy system can not only improve the positioning accuracy and reduce positioning errors but also narrow the PTV margin and reduce the radiated volume of normal tissue.']
