["Mortality-to-incidence ratios (MIRs) are alternative parameters used to evaluate the prognosis of a disease. In addition, MIRs are associated with the ranking of health care systems and expenditures for certain types of cancer. However, a lack of association between MIRs and pancreatic cancer has been noted. Given the poor prognosis of brain and nervous system cancers, similar to pancreatic cancer, the relation of MIRs and health care disparities is worth investigating. We used the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (CC) to analyze the correlation between the MIRs in brain and nervous system cancers and inter-country disparities, including expenditures on health and human development index. Interestingly, the MIRs in brain and nervous system cancers are associated with the human development index score (N = 157, CC = -0.394, p &lt; 0.001), current health expenditure (CHE) per capita (N = 157, CC = -0.438, p &lt; 0.001), and CHE as percentage of gross domestic product (N = 157, CC = -0.245, p = 0.002). In conclusion, the MIRs in the brain and nervous system cancer are significantly associated with health expenditures and human development index. However, their role as an indicator of health disparity warrants further investigation."]
