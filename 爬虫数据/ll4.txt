['Simple Summary The overall survival of <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> patients remains grim, with conventional therapies such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy only providing marginal benefits to patient survival. Cancers are complex, with multiple pathways being dysregulated simultaneously. Non-coding RNAs such as microRNA (miRNAs) are gaining importance due to their potential in regulating a variety of targets implicated in the pathology of cancers. This could be leveraged for the development of targeted and personalized therapies for cancers. Since miRNAs can upregulate and/or downregulate proteins, this review aims to understand the role of these miRNAs in primary and metastatic brain cancers. Here, we discuss the regulatory mechanisms of ten miRNAs that are highly dysregulated in glioblastoma and metastatic <span class="hitHilite">brain tumors</span>. This will enable researchers to develop miRNA-based targeted cancer therapies and identify potential prognostic biomarkers. <span class="hitHilite">Brain cancer</span> is one among the rare cancers with high mortality rate that affects both children and adults. The most aggressive form of primary brain tumor is glioblastoma. Secondary <span class="hitHilite">brain tumors</span> most commonly metastasize from primary cancers of lung, breast, or melanoma. The five-year survival of primary and secondary <span class="hitHilite">brain tumors</span> is 34% and 2.4%, respectively. Owing to poor prognosis, tumor heterogeneity, increased tumor relapse, and resistance to therapies, brain cancers have high mortality and poor survival rates compared to other cancers. Early diagnosis, effective targeted treatments, and improved prognosis have the potential to increase the survival rate of patients with primary and secondary brain malignancies. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short noncoding RNAs of approximately 18-22 nucleotides that play a significant role in the regulation of multiple genes. With growing interest in the development of miRNA-based therapeutics, it is crucial to understand the differential role of these miRNAs in the given cancer scenario. This review focuses on the differential expression of ten miRNAs (miR-145, miR-31, miR-451, miR-19a, miR-143, miR-125b, miR-328, miR-210, miR-146a, and miR-126) in glioblastoma and brain metastasis. These miRNAs are highly dysregulated in both primary and metastatic <span class="hitHilite">brain tumors</span>, which necessitates a better understanding of their role in these cancers. In the context of the tumor microenvironment and the expression of different genes, these miRNAs possess both oncogenic and/or tumor-suppressive roles within the same cancer.']
