['Frozen food chemicals contain neurotoxins which disturb electrolyte levels. Altered electrolyte levels can induce mental illnesses. This study was focused on finding the prevalence of depression, dementia, intake of antidepressants and electrolytic alterations in <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> (BC) patients and in control group (CG) who were taking frozen and canned food. The levels of electrolytes were compared in both groups through Mann-Whitney U test. The Odds Ratio (OR) and Relative Risks (RR) were calculated of having a specific occurrence or condition of <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> patients vs. controls. Majority (41.42%) patients were from the age group 33-57 years. There were 52% male and 47% female patients. There was more occurrence of dementia (41%) and depression (6%) in patients as compared to CG. 94% patients were found with dementia. 32% patients were having low levels of sodium and 43% were having low levels of potassium. High levels of potassium (26%) were found in CG. 76% patients and 73% controls were taking canned food in moderation. 69% patients and 50% controls were taking frozen food in moderation. The potassium levels (p value: 0.00001) and sodium levels (p value: 0.01468) were found at significant difference in <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> patients and control group. Statistically significantly higher odds of outcome (OR&gt;1) and increased relative risks (RR) were reported in dementia, depression and intake of anti-depressants for BC vs. CG. This epidemiological study reports hyponatremia as a significantly different parameter between <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> patients and controls. Food\'s chemicals induce hyponatremia, which can disturb mental states to develop different neurological conditions.']
