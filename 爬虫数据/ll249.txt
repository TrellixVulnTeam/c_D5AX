['Objective: The aim of this study was to compare cancer incidence rates (CIRs), between preexposure (1995-2000) and postexposure (2002-2014) periods in the entire New York City Police Department cohort exposed to the 2001 World Trade Center (WTC) disaster. Methods: CIR derived from active duty officer records, including postexposure data on retired officers. Results: We observed 870 cancer cases in 859 officers (1995-2014), including 193 active duty cases pre-WTC and 677 cases (484 active duty, 193 retired) post-WTC. Overall, median CIR increased 1.44-fold compared with pre-WTC, with <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> increasing 3.27-fold, and kidney cancer increasing similarly. Thyroid cancer and non-Hodgkin\'s lymphoma increased 2.29 and 1.68-fold, respectively. Conclusions: Findings should be interpreted cautiously, given the small number of cancers at specific sites, and possibility of confounders. However, apparent increases in cancers overall, and in highlighted sites, remain of concern, underscoring the need for continued monitoring of this cohort.']
