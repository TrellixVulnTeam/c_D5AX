['To determine the variability in processes of care in the last 6 months of life experienced by patients dying of primary <span class="hitHilite">intracranial tumors</span> and potential predictors of place of death, a death-backwards cohort was assembled using historical data and 1,623 decedents were identified. 90 % of people had a parts per thousand yen1 admission to an acute care hospital and 23 % spent a parts per thousand yen3 months of their last 6 months of life in acute care. 44 % had a parts per thousand yen1 ER visits and 30 % were admitted a parts per thousand yen1 times to ICU. Only 18 % had a home visit by a physician. 10 % died at home but 49 % died in hospital, while 40 % died in a palliative care facility. Age, comorbidities, and being diagnosed with grade 4 astrocytoma were associated with greater burden of care. Level of care burden and age were associated with higher odds of dying in a treatment intensive place of death, being diagnosed with grade 4 astrocytoma had opposite effect. Despite valuable research efforts to improve the treatment of primary <span class="hitHilite">intracranial tumors</span> that focus on biology, refinements to surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, there is also room to improve aspects of care at the end of life situation. An integrative approach for this patients\' population, from diagnosis to death, could potentially reduce the care burden in the final period on the health care system, patient\'s family and improve access to a better place of death.']
