['Background: According to a fundamental law of radiobiology ("Law of Bergonie and Tribondeau", 1906), the brain is a paradigm of a highly differentiated organ with low mitotic activity, and is thus radio-resistant. This assumption has been challenged by recent evidence discussed in the present review.\n<br/>\n<br/>Results: Ionizing radiation is an established environmental cause of <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span>. Although direct evidence is lacking in contemporary fluoroscopy due to obvious sample size limitation, limited follow-up time and lack of focused research, anecdotal reports of clusters have appeared in the literature, raising the suspicion that <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> may be a professional disease of interventional cardiologists. In addition, although terminally differentiated neurons have reduced or mild proliferative capacity, and are therefore not regarded as critical radiation targets, adult neurogenesis occurs in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and the olfactory bulb, and is important for mood, learning/memory and normal olfactory function, whose impairment is a recognized early biomarker of neurodegenerative diseases. The head doses involved in radiotherapy are high, usually above 2 Sv, whereas the low-dose range of professional exposure typically involves lifetime cumulative whole-body exposure in the low-dose range of &lt; 200 mSv, but with head exposure which may (in absence of protection) arrive at a head equivalent dose of 1 to 3 Sv after a professional lifetime (corresponding to a brain equivalent dose around 500 mSv).\n<br/>\n<br/>Conclusions: At this point, a systematic assessment of <span class="hitHilite">brain (cancer</span> and non-cancer) effects of chronic low-dose radiation exposure in interventional cardiologists and staff is needed.']
