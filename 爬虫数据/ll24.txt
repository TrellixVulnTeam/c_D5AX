['Efficacious therapies are not available for the cure of both gliomas and glioneuronal tumors, which represent the most numerous and heterogeneous primary cancers of the central nervous system (CNS), and for neoplasms of the peripheral nervous system (PNS), which can be divided into benign tumors, mainly represented by schwannomas and neurofibromas, and malignant tumors of the peripheral nerve sheath (MPNST). Increased cellular oxidative stress and other metabolic aspects have been reported as potential etiologies in the nervous system tumors. Thus polyphenols have been tested as effective natural compounds likely useful for the prevention and therapy of this group of neoplasms, because of their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity. However, polyphenols show poor intestinal absorption due to individual intestinal microbiota content, poor bioavailability, and difficulty in passing the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Recently, polymeric nanoparticle-based polyphenol delivery improved their gastrointestinal absorption, their bioavailability, and entry into defined target organs. Herein, we summarize recent findings about the primary polyphenols employed for nervous system tumor prevention and treatment. We describe the limitations of their application in clinical practice and the new strategies aimed at enhancing their bioavailability and targeted delivery.']
