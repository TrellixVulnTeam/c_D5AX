['Background: Metastatic or primary cancers of the central nervous system are a dissimilar cluster of neoplasms with different consequences and management plans. The aim of this study was to obtain prevalence and incidence of brain and other nervous system tumors.\n<br/>\n<br/>Results: In all, 423 females and 620 males were identified. For the total population the period prevalence (PP) was calculated as 20.9 per 100,000 persons. This value corresponded to a PP of 24.5 for males and 17.2 for females. The mean (SD, range) age of the patients was 52.0 (20.7, 1-99) years. In the 7% of the population studied, age was under 20 years old of life, and in the 71%, it occurred around the age of 20 to 70 years old. In both genders, incidence rate (IR) increased from 4.2 to 5.7 per 100,000 persons. The changes of IR in males versus females were 8.2 versus 3.0 from 2011 to 6.4 versus 5.0 to 2015 per 100,000 persons.\n<br/>\n<br/>Conclusions: Among the total population studied, there were 586 reported deaths. The PP in the male population was 1.4-times higher than females. There was a 35.7% increase in the IR over the study period.']
