['\n<span class="hitHilite">Brain tumors</span> are notoriously difficult to treat. The blood-brain barrier provides a sanctuary site where residual and metastatic cancer cells can evade most therapeutic modalities. The delicate nature of the brain further complicates the decision of eliminating as much tumorous tissue as possible while protecting healthy tissue. Despite recent advances in immunotherapy, radiotherapy and systemic treatments, prognosis of newly diagnosed patients remains dismal, and recurrence is still a universal problem. Several strategies are now under preclinical and clinical investigation to optimize delivery and maximize the cytotoxic potential of pharmaceuticals with regards to <span class="hitHilite">brain tumors</span>. This review provides an overview of targeted radionuclide therapy approaches for the treatment of primary <span class="hitHilite">brain tumors</span> and brain metastases, with an emphasis on biological targeting moieties that specifically target key biomarkers involved in cancer development.']
