['Background: Case-control studies have reported an inverse association between self-reported history of allergy and risk of glioma, but cohort data are limited. Our objectives were to evaluate the associations of major groups of medically diagnosed immune-related conditions (allergy/atopy, autoimmune disease, diabetes, infectious/inflammatory disease) and to explore associations with specific conditions in relation to subsequent diagnosis of <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> in a large cohort study.\n<br/>\n<br/>Methods: We used hospital discharge records for a cohort of 4.5 million male US veterans, of whom 4383 developed primary <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span>. Rate ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using time-dependent Poisson regression.\n<br/>\n<br/>Results: We found a significant trend of decreasing RRs for <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> with longer duration of allergy/atopy (P 0.02), but not for other conditions studied. Rate ratios of <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> for allergy/atopy and diabetes with duration of 10 or more years were 0.60 (95% CI: 0.43, 0.83) and 0.75 (95% CI: 0.62, 0.93), respectively. Several associations with specific conditions were found, but these did not withstand correction for multiple comparisons.\n<br/>\n<br/>Conclusions: This study lends some support to an inverse association between allergy/atopy and diabetes of long duration and <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> risk, but prospective studies with biological samples are needed to uncover the underlying biological mechanisms.']
