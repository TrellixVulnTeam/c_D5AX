['Background Investigation of <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> can detect the abnormal growth of tissue in the brain using computed tomography (CT) scans and magnetic resonance (MR) images of patients. The proposed method classifies <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> on shape-based feature extraction as either benign or malignant. The authors used input variables such as shape distance (SD) and shape similarity measure (SSM) in fuzzy tools, and used fuzzy rules to evaluate the risk status as an output variable. We presented a classifier neural network system (NNS), namely Levenberg-Marquardt (LM), which is a feed-forward back-propagation learning algorithm used to train the NN for the status of <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span>, if any, and which achieved satisfactory performance with 100% accuracy.\n<br/>\n<br/>Methods The proposed methodology is divided into three phases. First, we find the region of interest (ROI) in the brain to detect the tumors using CT and MR images. Second, we extract the shape-based features, like SD and SSM, and grade the <span class="hitHilite">brain tumors</span> as benign or malignant with the concept of SD function and SSM as shape-based parameters. Third, we classify the brain cancers using neuro-fuzzy tools. In this experiment, we used a 16-sample database with SSM (mu) values and classified the benignancy or malignancy of the brain tumor lesions using the neuro-fuzzy system (NFS).\n<br/>\n<br/>Results We have developed a fuzzy expert system (FES) and NFS for early detection of <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> from CT and MR images. In this experiment, shape-based features, such as SD and SSM, were extracted from the ROI of brain tumor lesions. These shape-based features were considered as input variables and, using fuzzy rules, we were able to evaluate <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> risk values for each case. We used an NNS with LM, a feed-forward back-propagation learning algorithm, as a classifier for the diagnosis of <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> and achieved satisfactory performance with 100% accuracy. The proposed network was trained with MR image datasets of 16 cases. The 16 cases were fed to the ANN with 2 input neurons, one hidden layer of 10 neurons and 2 output neurons. Of the 16-sample database, 10 datasets for training, 3 datasets for validation, and 3 datasets for testing were used in the ANN classification system. From the SSM (A mu) confusion matrix, the number of output datasets of true positive, false positive, true negative and false negative was 6, 0, 10, and 0, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were each equal to 100%.\n<br/>\n<br/>Conclusion The method of diagnosing <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> presented in this study is a successful model to assist doctors in the screening and treatment of <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> patients. The presented FES successfully identified the presence of <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> in CT and MR images using the extracted shape-based features and the use of NFS for the identification of <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> in the early stages. From the analysis and diagnosis of the disease, the doctors can decide the stage of cancer and take the necessary steps for more accurate treatment. Here, we have presented an investigation and comparison study of the shape-based feature extraction method with the use of NFS for classifying <span class="hitHilite">brain tumors</span> as showing normal or abnormal patterns. The results have proved that the shape-based features with the use of NFS can achieve a satisfactory performance with 100% accuracy. We intend to extend this methodology for the early detection of cancer in other regions such as the prostate region and human cervix.']
