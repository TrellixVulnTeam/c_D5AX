['\n<span class="hitHilite">Brain tumors</span> are a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in the United States. Malignant <span class="hitHilite">brain tumors</span> occur in approximately 80,000 adults. Furthermore, the average 5-year survival rate for malignant <span class="hitHilite">brain tumors</span> across all ages and races is approximately 30% and has remained relatively static over the past few decades, showing the need for continued research and progress in brain tumor therapy. Improved techniques in molecular biology have expanded understanding of tumor genetics and permitted viral engineering and the anticancer therapeutic use of viruses as directly cytotoxic agents and as gene vectors. Preclinical models have shown promising antitumor effects, and generation of clinical grade vectors is feasible. In parallel to these developments, better understanding of antitumor immunity has been accompanied by progress in cancer immunotherapy, the goal of which is to stimulate host rejection of a growing tumor. This article reviews the intersection between the use of viral therapy and immunotherapy in the treatment of malignant gliomas. Each approach shows great promise on its own and in combined or integrated forms.']
