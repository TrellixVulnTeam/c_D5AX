['Dysregulation of receptor tyrosine kinase-induced pathways is a critical step driving the oncogenic potential of <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span>. In this study, we investigated the role of two members of the Sprouty (Spry) family in <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span>-derived cell lines. Using immunoblot analyses we found essential differences in the pattern of endogenous Spry3 and Spry4 expression. While Spry4 expression was mitogen-dependent and repressed in a number of cells from higher malignant brain cancers, Spry3 levels neither fluctuated in response to serum withdrawal nor were repressed in glioblastoma (GBM)-derived cell lines. In accordance to the well-known inhibitory role of Spry proteins in fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-mediated signaling, both Spry proteins were able to interfere with FGF-induced activation of the MAPK pathway although to a different extent. In response to serum solely, Spry4 exerts its role as a negative regulator of MAPK activation. Ectopic expression of Spry4 inhibited proliferation and migration of GBM-originated cells, positioning it as a tumor suppressor in <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span>. In contrast, elevated Spry3 levels accelerated both proliferation and migration of these cell lines, while repression of Spry3 levels using shRNA caused a significant diminished growth and migration velocity rate of a GBM-derived cell line. This argues for a tumor-promoting function of Spry3 in GBMs. Based on these data we conclude that Spry3 and Spry4 fulfill different if not opposing roles within the cancerogenesis of brain malignancies.']
