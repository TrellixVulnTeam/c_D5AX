['Cancer is one of the most important causes of morbidity and mortality all across the world. On an average, every year approximately 238,000 new cases of brain and other central nervous system tumors are diagnosed around the world. Amongst all, tumors of brain account for nearly 85% to 90% of all primary central nervous system (CNS) tumors. Regardless of tremendous scientific efforts to develop newer diagnostic techniques and latest therapy, the management of <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> is still a challenge in neuro-oncology. Inadequate concentration of chemotherapeutics at the site of tumor restricts the complete destruction of malignant cells due to the presence of blood brain barrier. Besides, there is a necessity for improvement in tumor imaging for better characterization and visualization of tumor cells for surgical procedure. Nanoparticles offer the advantages upon many of these concerns i.e., diagnosis, capability to target therapeutic agents to the tumor sites and the ability of getting across the blood-brain barrier. Thus utilization of nanoparticles may lead to breakthrough in <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> management.']
