['Background and purpose:\n<br/>\n<br/>The overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and its mutated variant EGFRvIII occurs in 50% of glioblastoma multiforme. We developed antibody fragments against EGFR/EGFRvIII for molecular imaging and/or therapeutic targeting applications.\n<br/>\n<br/>Experimental approach:\n<br/>\n<br/>An anti-EGFR/EGFRvIII llama single-domain antibody (EG(2)) and two higher valency format constructs, bivalent EG(2)-hFc and pentavalent V2C-EG(2) sdAbs, were analysed in vitro for their binding affinities using surface plasmon resonance and cell binding studies, and in vivo using pharmacokinetic, biodistribution, optical imaging and fluorescent microscopy studies.\n<br/>\n<br/>Key results:\n<br/>\n<br/>Kinetic binding analyses by surface plasmon resonance revealed intrinsic affinities of 55 nM and 97 nM for the monovalent EG(2) to immobilized extracellular domains of EGFR and EGFRvIII, respectively, and a 10- to 600-fold increases in apparent affinities for the multivalent binders, V2C-EG(2) and EG(2)-hFc, respectively. In vivo pharmacokinetic and biodistribution studies in mice revealed plasma half-lives for EG(2), V2C-EG(2) and EG(2)-hFc of 41 min, 80 min and 12.5 h, respectively, as well as a significantly higher retention of EG(2)-hFc compared to the other two constructs in EGFR/EGFRvIII-expressing orthotopic brain tumours, resulting in the highest signal in the tumour region in optical imaging studies. Time domain volumetric optical imaging fusion with high-resolution micro-computed tomography of microvascular brain network confirmed EG(2)-hFc selective accumulation/retention in anatomically defined tumour regions.\n<br/>\n<br/>Conclusions:\n<br/>\n<br/>Single domain antibodies can be optimized for molecular imaging applications by methods that improve their apparent affinity and prolong plasma half-life and, at the same time, preserve their ability to penetrate tumour parenchyma.']
