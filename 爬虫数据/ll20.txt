['Purpose of Review Provide an overview, the indications for use, and a synopsis of current literature regarding two evolving neurosurgical interventions-GammaTile therapy (GTT) and laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT). Recent Findings GTT delivers immediate, uniform, high-dose radiation with avoidance of direct brain-to-seed contact. Innate properties of the novel carrier system and cesium-131 source may explain lower observed rate of radiation-induced necrosis (RIN) and support use in larger and previously irradiated lesions. LITT delivers focal laser energy to cause heat-generated necrosis. Case series suggest use in difficult-to-access lesions and treatment of RIN. Collaboration among subspecialties and remaining up-to-date on evolving technology is critical in developing individualized treatment plans for patients with <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span>. While patients should be thoroughly counseled that these interventions are not standard of care, in optimal clinical scenarios, GTT and LITT could extend quantity and quality of life for patients with few remaining options. Prospective studies are needed to establish specific treatment parameters.']
