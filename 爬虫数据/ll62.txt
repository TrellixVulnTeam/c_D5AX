['Progress in nanomedicine has enabled the development of smart hybrid nanostructures (HNSs) for <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> theranostics, a novel platform that can diagnose the brain while concurrently beginning primary treatment, initiating secondary treatments where necessary, and monitoring the therapy response. These HNSs can release guest molecules/cargoes directly to <span class="hitHilite">brain tumors</span> in response to external physical stimuli. Such physical stimulation is generally referred to as remote stimuli which can be externally applied examples include alternating magnetic field, visible or near-infrared light, ultrasound radiation, X-ray, and radio- frequency. The release of therapeutic cargoes in response to physical Magnetic Nanostructures ring stimuli can be performed along with photodynamic therapy, photothermal therapy, phototriggered chemotherapeutics, sonodynamic therapy, electrothermal therapy, and magnetothermal therapy. Herein, we review different HNSs currently used as remotely triggered modalities in <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span>, such as organic-inorganic HNSs, polymer micelles, and liposomes HNSs. We also summarize underlying mechanisms of remote triggering <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> therapeutics including single- and two-photon triggering, thermoresponsive HNSs, photoresponsive HNSs, magnetoresponsive HNSs, and electrically and ultrasound-stimulated HNSs. In addition to a brief synopsis of ongoing research progress on "smart" HNSs-based platforms of novel <span class="hitHilite">brain cancer</span> therapeutics, the review offers an up-to-date development in this field for neurooncologists, material/nanoscientists, and radiologists so that a rapid clinical impact can be achieved through a convergence of multidisciplinary expertise.']
